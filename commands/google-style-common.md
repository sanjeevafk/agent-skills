# Google Style — Common Principles

Google publishes separate style guides per language, but several core
philosophies run through all of them. This skill surfaces those cross-cutting
principles so language-specific skills can stay lean.

## Naming Philosophy

Google's naming rules are built on one idea: **names communicate intent to a
human reader, not a machine**. Prefer clarity over brevity.

| Concept | Google rule |
|---|---|
| Abbreviations | Only well-known ones (HTTP, URL). Spell out the rest. |
| Single-letter names | Only for loop counters and conventionally agreed vars (e.g. `i`, `x` in math) |
| Negated booleans | Avoid `isNotReady` — use `isReady` and invert the check |
| Acronyms in names | Treat as words: `getHtmlContent`, not `getHTMLContent` (except HTTP, URL in some guides) |
| Names to avoid | Confusing overloads of built-ins, names differing only by case |

## Comments Philosophy

- Write comments for **why**, not **what** — the code already shows what it does.
- A comment that paraphrases the code adds no value and becomes a maintenance burden when the code changes.
- Every public API (function, class, module) deserves a documentation comment; private implementation details need comments only when non-obvious.
- Use TODO comments for known issues: `TODO(username): fix this when X lands`.
- Keep comments up to date — stale, wrong comments are worse than no comments.

## Formatting Philosophy

- Consistent formatting within a project matters more than any particular style.
- Automated formatters (Black, gofmt, Prettier, clang-format) are preferred; they remove the argument entirely.
- **Line length**: 80 characters is the universal Google default. Some guides allow up to 100. Never go beyond 120.
- Indentation is always spaces, never tabs (except where the language mandates tabs, e.g. Go's gofmt).
- Trailing whitespace is never permitted.

## Error Handling Philosophy

- Never silently swallow errors.
- Propagate errors to callers rather than logging-and-continuing unless at an explicit isolation boundary.
- Use specific exception/error types; avoid catching the base `Exception` / `Error` broadly.
- Document what errors a function can raise in its docstring/JSDoc.

## Dependency & Import Philosophy

- Import only what you use.
- Organise imports in consistent blocks (stdlib → third-party → local).
- Avoid circular dependencies; they signal a structural problem.
- Prefer explicit full-path imports over implicit relative ones.

## Testing Philosophy

- Tests live close to the code they test.
- Each test case should test one behaviour, not a scenario with multiple unrelated assertions.
- Test names should describe the behaviour, not the method name (`test_returns_empty_list_when_no_items`, not `test_get_items`).
- Avoid testing implementation details; test observable behaviour.

## When to load a language-specific skill

This skill covers shared principles only. For language-specific rules, load:
- `google-style-python` — Python
- `google-style-typescript` — TypeScript
- `google-style-javascript` — JavaScript
- `google-style-go` — Go
- `google-style-java` — Java
- `google-style-cpp` — C++
- `google-style-shell` — Shell / Bash
- `google-style-markdown` — Markdown / documentation
