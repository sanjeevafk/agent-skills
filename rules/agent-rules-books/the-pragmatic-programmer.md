# The Pragmatic Programmer: Mini

## When to use

Use as a general engineering operating style when the goal is adaptability, fast feedback, and responsibility for outcomes.

## Primary bias to correct

Do not optimize only for the local edit; optimize for the whole result.

## Decision rules

- Own the result. Surface trade-offs, risks, and uncertainty instead of hiding behind tools, defaults, or existing style.
- DRY means one authoritative source of knowledge. Do not duplicate business rules, validation semantics, status meanings, or manual process steps across layers.
- Preserve orthogonality: separate policy from mechanism, orchestration from computation, and avoid hidden couplings that make one change leak everywhere.
- Prefer thin end-to-end tracer bullets over piles of isolated pieces. Validate the path and assumptions early.
- Use prototypes to learn, but be explicit about what they prove and do not let experimental shortcuts fossilize into production defaults.
- Automate repetitive, error-prone work. Build, test, release, setup, and validation should be reproducible and aligned with CI.
- Shorten feedback loops. Prefer cheap early failure signals through tests, types, linters, and scripts over late expensive surprises.
- Make contracts and assumptions explicit. Distinguish programmer errors, contract violations, and expected domain failures.
- Favor inspectable text, configs, and scripts where longevity, integration, or automation matter.
- Treat shared mutable state and async complexity as costs that must earn themselves.
- Apply the broken windows rule: leave touched code, tooling, or docs slightly better than before.

## Trigger rules

- When the same rule appears in multiple layers or files, choose one owner and derive the rest.
- When a change requires edits in many unrelated places, look for missing orthogonality or a hidden shared concern.
- When repeated manual steps or environment rituals appear, automate them before they become tribal knowledge.
- When a prototype, script, or integration shortcut starts leaking into durable code, either harden it deliberately or replace it.
- When hidden assumptions live only in comments or caller folklore, move them into code, contracts, or automation.

## Final checklist

- One owner per piece of knowledge?
- Change still localized?
- Feedback loop shorter or at least not worse?
- Repeated manual work reduced?
- Touched area slightly better?
